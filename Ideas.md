# Script Ideas

This is a list of possible scripts that could be researched or implemented.

## Model Checking / Change Management
status: still checking possibilities with available tools (Navisworks, ..?.. )
- Model Comparison (find deleted, new, changed elements)
  - see Data Shapes: https://data-shapes.io/2016/12/31/modification-tracking-with-dynamo-and-data-shapes/ and https://github.com/MostafaElAyoubi/Data-shapes
  - see Metamorphosis: https://github.com/mattmas/Metamorphosis
  

## Rooms and Spaces
- Create Spaces from architecture Rooms âœ“
  - There is already a workflow for this in RF tools > Project Setup 
- Link Spaces to Rooms and move parameter data to Spaces
- Keep track of Space/Room connections and changes

## Insulation
- Manage rogue insulation âœ“
- Add Insulation based on EnEV/manufacturer rules

## Visualization
- Color Elements based on some rule (velocity, pressure, etc.)
  See here: K:\Computational_Share\Computational Collective Berlin\DynamoScriptDump_MAR4. FLOORS_ColorFloors.dyn and PIPES_ColorPipesAndDucts.dyn
- Create Color Schemes

## Schedules
- Create Schedules for quantification/costing

## Piping
- Automatic Pipe Sizing

## Ducting
- Automatic Duct Sizing

## Tagging
- Automatic Tagging / Tag Placement
  - Riser Tagging ðŸ—²
- Tag Alignment

## Clash Detection / Reporting
- Show Isolate Clashes From Interference Check Report
